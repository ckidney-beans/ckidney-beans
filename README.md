## Welcome ##

This is my corner of GitHub.  Recently I have just reignited an interest in programming and networking, and have been learning about systems such as Proxmox, Docker, Linux, Vim, and others, with a goal to get into ethical hacking and coding, likely in python.  I have also taken an interest in homelabs, self hosting,

Other areas of my interests include 3D printing and auto racing, especially Formula 1, and road endurance.  I am also a novice sim racer.

Feel free to reach out with you have any comments, questions, or just friendly advice in this areas.ðŸ‘‹
